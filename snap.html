above two graphs show the budget distribution for FNS (Food nutrition
services) and number of people served by those three nutrition
programs. In specific, SNAP takes three times more FNS budget than
WIC and School Lunch program. And the number of participants of SNAP
are roughly the WIC and School Lunch combined. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Across
the three years from 2016 to 2018, the budget to the WIC and SNAP
declined, and correspondingly, the number of participants declined as
well. A little bit more funds went to School Lunch program and the
participants increased over the year.  </FONT>

1989 to 2018, the SNAP participation number in US increased from
below two millions to about four millions, almost doubled in two
decades. The peaks within the two decades happened at year 1994 and
year 2013, reached over 2.5 millions and over 4.5 millions
respectively. Connecting to the previous SNAP timeline graph, SNAP
reached participation milestone for those two years.  The Food Stamp
Nutrition Education program at 1992 and Mickey Leland Childhood
Hunger Relief Act at 1993 influenced the growth of SNAP, the
participants increased dramatically afterwards. And from 2002 to
2014, there are five events happened that drove the SNAP participaion
greatly.</FONT></P>

population of SNAP program in US across the 51 states, four regions,

Wyoming has the fewest participants, about 0.1 million.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The
first map is the US base map with state names labeled. From the US
state map, combining with SNAP participation data, we can see that
state AL, ND, SD and NH have the highest participation rate. This is
reasonable as these states are less developed and tend to have more
poor people. The participation rate range is not very big, therefore
the colors are generally darker. Most of the states have
participation rate around 0.00002 or lower.  </FONT>

a US Food Tax map across states and comparing it with the previous

where the index moved from near 2.3 to over 8.6. It is notable that
in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, the index increased
over the period from 1996 to 2014, meaning that SNAP policies became

participation population, unemployment rate, and poverty rate have
similar trends. Unemployment rate change fluctuates more than the
other two rates, while the poverty rate change is the most consistent
over the years. One outlier is in 1971, the SNAP population doubled
compared to the previous year and then came back.</P>

1989 to 2018, the benefits per person increased dramatically. From
around 50 dollars to above 250 dollars, the dollar benefitfive is
currenly five times more than from the beginning. The color scale
shows the range of unemployment rate over the years. The unemployment
rate fluctuates from 1989 to 2008, and increased dramatically around
2008 to 2014, which is the financial crisis period. The benefit per
person decreased a little, but after the crisis, the benefit jumped
very high till around 250 dollars per person and came back to around
125 in the most recent year.  </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The longitudinal estimates compare new
SNAP participants to the same participants about six months later. 
Tabulations are based on the following overall sample sizes: 3,275
new-entrant households and 3,375 six-month households in the
cross-sectional sample; and 3,275 new-entrant households observed at
baseline and again at follow up six months later in the longitudinal
sample.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We can see that the orange area leans
towards good side more than the blue area, which suggests that the
health status after six month for SNAP participants is better than
the start of the survey.</P>
